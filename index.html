    <h1>What is Skin Cycling?</h1>

    <p>Skin cycling was created by 
        <a href="https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/blogs/derm-scribbles/skin-cycling-dr-bowes-viral-beauty-editor-approved-skincare-method">
        Dr. Whitney Bowe</a> 
        and it is a strategic method for cycling through your nightly skincare products to drive
    the best results. This was created with skin barrier optimization in mind and it encourages you to use products in a 
    strategic way to compliment one another.</p>
    <p> Skin cycling involves a 4 night cycle which includes <em> Exfoliation Night, Retinoid Night 
            and Recovery Nights.</em></p>

        <p> Let's begin by describing each night:
            <b>
            <ol>
                <li>Exfoliation Night</li>
                <li>Retinoid Night</li>
                <li>Recovery Night 1</li>
                <li>Recovery Night 2</li>
            </ol>
            </b>

            This should be paired with a morning routine in which the basics include: 1. Facial Cleanser, 2. Moisturizer and 3. Sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 30.
